# p5backups

Original script published here [http://provideotech.org/automatically-backing-up-p5-indexes/]

Need to add logging and other features 

- logging

- make sure server is back up and running

# P5 Server backup

A new script "p5_up.py" added to check if P5 server is running. If it isn't make it so!

:)
